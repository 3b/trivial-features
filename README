describe trivial-features here

this is a proof-of-concept release.  Lots of questions:

  - should we not use the keyword package for our feature symbols?
  - how much information should we push to *features*?

See SPEC.

The test suite is, in effect, an implementation using CFFI that is
checked against the various implementations in src/tf-*.lisp.
