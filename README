describe trivial-features here

this is a proof-of-concept release.  Lots of questions:

  - should we not use the keyword package for our feature symbols?
  - how much information should we push to *features*?

The various feature symbols should be documented so that various
implementations can add these features themselves and render this
library unnecessary.
